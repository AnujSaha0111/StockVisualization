# Stock Visualization

## Finance and Financial Reporting

### Project Idea:
Analyze historical stock market data using `pandas` to identify trends and patterns. Use `matplotlib` to visualize stock price movements over time, and `pandas` to calculate financial metrics such as moving averages, volatility, and returns. You can also explore financial reporting practices by comparing the financial statements of different companies in the same industry.

### Key Features:
- Fetch historical stock market data using `yfinance`.
- Utilize `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- Visualize stock price movements over time using `matplotlib`.
- Calculate financial metrics such as moving averages, volatility, and returns.
- Compare financial statements of companies within the same industry.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnujSaha0111/StockVisualization.git
```

### 2. Install the required dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python dependencies using the command:

```bash
cd StockVisualization
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook
To start the Jupyter Notebook and run the data_analysis.ipynb notebook, use the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Once Jupyter opens in your web browser, navigate to the data_analysis.ipynb file and open it. Run the cells to visualize stock data.

## Usage

Modify the code in `data_analysis.ipynb` to analyze data for different time periods or companies.  
Experiment with different financial metrics and visualizations to gain insights into stock market trends.

## To Know Before Usage

1. I have done my financial reporting in the `Stock_Visualization` file by taking Google, Microsoft, and Apple as my companies for Technology Industries. You can use any company by simply changing the ticker.
   
2. In the `Financial_Reporting` section, you can change the name of the companies whose financial reports you want to analyze. You will need to edit the loading of the financial statement, as different companies have different formats. Get the financial reports of your desired company and experiment with different financial metrics and visualizations to gain insights into stock market trends.
